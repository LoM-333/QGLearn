# QGLearn
QGLearn is a group of students brought together through the internships program held by QWorld. Led by Vesselin Gueorguiev, our product strives to accomplish the goals of QIntern's Project 9: gamifying quantum subjects. Our work is constrained by factors such as time (one month), distance (involvement of various continents), and the limitations of replicating quantum technologies on classical computers. Additionally, our skills range from classical programming to AI engineering. Most of our team members needed to pick up game design and an understanding of related quantum topics.

## Abstract
This project aims to accomplish an escape-room style game to gamify quantum concepts through Godot. More specifically, the game focuses on the Deutsch Algorithm, aspiring to help quantum learners visualize and interact with qubits, gates, and oracles. In the future, we hope to proceed to gamify more complex algorithms such as QFT, Shor's, Grover's, and potentially look into additional quantum subjects like cryptography.

## Project Goals
☐ Visualize qubit states, gate interactions, and quantum algorithms through an escape-room style game
<br>
☐ Provide players with an understanding of quantum circuit building and qubit transformations as a result of environmental factors
<br>
☐ Implement the Deutsch Algorithm concepts and circuit in a method that will be easy to comprehend
<br>
☐ Publish a working prototype of the game mechanics with Godot
<br>
☐ Target complex topics like quantum algorithms in hopes of inspiring quantum researchers to advance current technologies
<br>
☐ Make quantum learning more accessible and fun to individuals of all levels!
