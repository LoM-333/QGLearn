## Abstract
This project aims to accomplish an escape-room style game to gamify quantum concepts through Godot. More specifically, the game focuses on the Deutsch Algorithm, aspiring to help quantum learners visualize and interact with qubits, gates, and oracles. In the future, we hope to proceed to gamify more complex algorithms such as QFT, Shor's, Grover's, and potentially look into additional quantum subjects like cryptography. Our work is a product of our participation in QIntern's 2025 program, led by our mentor Vesselin Gueorguiev (Project 9).

## Project Goals
☐ Visualize qubit states, gate interactions, and quantum algorithms through an escape-room style game
<br>
☐ Provide players with an understanding of quantum cicuit building and qubit transformations as a result of environmental factors
<br>
☐ Implement the Deutsch Algorithm concepts and circuit in a method that will be easy to comprehend
<br>
☐ Publish a working prototype with Godot
<br>
☐ Target complex topics like quantum algorithms in hopes of inspiring quantum researchers to advance current technologies
<br>
☐ Make quantum learning more accessible and fun to individuals of all levels!
