QIntern 2025 Project 9 - Gamification of Quantum Concepts
<br>
## Abstract
This project aims to accomplish an escape-room style game to gamify quantum concepts through Godot. More specifically, the game focuses on the Deutsch Algorithm, aspiring to help quantum learners visualize and interact with qubits, gates, and oracles. In the future, we hope to proceed to gamify more complex algorithms such as QFT, Shor's, Grover's, and potentially look into additional quantum subjects like cryptography. Our work is a product of our participation in QIntern's 2025 program, led by our mentor Vesselin Gueorguiev (Project 9).
